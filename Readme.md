# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to detect credit card fraud. The dataset is loaded using Pandas, exploring key statistics and visualizing relationships between variables. The data is split and scaled, followed by the implementation of two models: Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Methods
Data Exploration:

Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.
Checked for duplicates and visualized data relationships with Seaborn.
Data Splitting and Scaling:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Applied standard scaling to ensure uniformity.
Modeling:

Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed model performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Conclusion
This README provides a concise overview of the credit card fraud detection project, detailing the technologies used, methods applied, and the evaluation of the implemented models. The focus is on simplicity and clarity for easy comprehension.
